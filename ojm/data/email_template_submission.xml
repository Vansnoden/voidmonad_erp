                                Initial Assessment: Your manuscript will undergo an initial screening to ensure it meets 
                                our publishing standards and scope. This process typically takes 2-10 days.

                                Peer Review: If your manuscript passes the initial assessment, it will be sent for peer review.
                                The review process can take several weeks, depending on the availability of suitable reviewers 
                                and the level of revision required.
